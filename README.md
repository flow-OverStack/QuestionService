## Project Overview

QuestionService is a microservice in the Flow OverStack platform responsible for managing questions, including creation,
editing, retrieval, and moderation. It handles question-related business logic, such as tags, views, and votes.

## 🚀 Quick Start a ready-made API

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Quick Start](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/UserService?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start-a-ready-made-api) the User Service.
3. Copy [the docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/QuestionService/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file
   into one directory
4. Copy (and reconfigure if needed) [logstash.conf](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/QuestionService/blob/master/logstash.conf) file in the same directory
5. Create and configure `.env` file in the same directory:
   ```env
   QUESTION_DB_PASSWORD=db_password
   REDIS_PASSWORD=redis_password
   ```
6. On the first run (or after updating migrations), apply EF Core migrations to the database:

   **Option A — Automatic ✅ Recommended for Quick Start**

   In `docker-compose.yml`, temporarily add `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development` to the `question-service` environment:
   ```yaml
   question-service:
      # ... other variables
      environment:
        # ... other variables
        ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development
   ```
   Start the services — migrations will be applied automatically on startup.
   > ⚠️ After the first run, **remove** `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development` from `docker-compose.yml` and restart the container.

   **Option B — Manual SQL script (Production)**

   Generate a SQL script with `dotnet ef migrations script` and apply it to the database
      manually ([Production approach](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli#sql-scripts))
7. Start the service
    ```bash
   docker-compose -p questionservice -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
8. Explore endpoints at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` endpoint.

## Technologies and Patterns Used

* **.NET 9 & C#** — Core framework and language
* **ASP.NET Core** — HTTP API.
* **Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL** — Data access (Repository & Unit of Work patterns) to PostgreSQL database
* **Kafka** — Message queue that listens to main events
* **gRPC** — High-performance RPC interface
* **Redis** — Caching layer with short-lived entity caching and negative caching (null values caching)
* **Hot Chocolate** — GraphQL endpoint with built-in support for pagination, filtering, and sorting
* **Clean Architecture** — Layered separation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
* **Outbox Pattern** — ensures reliable message delivery to the message queue 
* **Decorator Pattern** — allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically without affecting others. In this project, it is used to implement caching.
* **Hangfire** — Hosted services for background jobs
* **Resilience** — Standard .NET resilience handler for HTTP clients (retries, circuit breaker, timeout), Hangfire retries and MassTransit retries, circuit breaker and kill switch
* **Observability** — Traces, logs, and metrics collected via OpenTelemetry and Logstash, exported to Aspire dashboard, Jaeger, ElasticSearch, and Prometheus
* **Monitoring & Visualization** — Dashboards in Grafana, Kibana, and Aspire
* **Health Checks** — Status endpoints to monitor service availability and dependencies
* **xUnit & Coverlet** — Automated unit and integration testing with code coverage
* **SonarQube & Qodana** — Code quality and coverage analysis

## Architecture and Design
This service follows the principles of Clean Architecture. The solution is split into multiple projects that correspond to each architectural layer.

## Getting Started for developers

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Reconfigure if needed `appsettings.json` and `.NET User Secrets` in `QuestionService.Api` with your database and Redis.
   `.NET User Secrets` example: 
   ```json
   {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
           "PostgresSQL": "Server=localhost;Port=5435; Database=question-service-db; User Id=<YOUR-USER-ID>; Password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>"
       },
       "RedisSettings": {
           "Password": "<YOUR-PASSWORD>"
       }
   }
   ```
3. Start the [UserService](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/UserService/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-for-developers) first, as QuestionService depends on it and common services (such as Kafka, Keycloak, etc.)
4. Start dependencies (you can use [Quick Start](#-quick-start-a-ready-made-api) or run your own services)
5. Run the API:

   ```bash
   cd QuestionService.Api
   dotnet run
   ```
   or use your IDE.
