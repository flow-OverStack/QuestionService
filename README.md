## Project Overview

QuestionService is a microservice in the Flow OverStack platform responsible for managing questions, including creation, editing, retrieval, and moderation. It handles question-related business logic, such as tags, views and votes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start a ready-made API
1. Intall [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Quick Start](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/UserService?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start-a-ready-made-api) the User Service.
3. Copy [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/QuestionService/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file into one directory
4. Copy (and reconfigure if needed) [logstash.conf](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/QuestionService/blob/master/logstash.conf) file in the same directory
5. Create and configure `.env` file in the same directory:
   ```env
   QUESTION_DB_PASSWORD=db_password
   REDIS_PASSWORD=redis_password
   ```
6. Start the service
    ```bash
   docker-compose -p questionservice -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

## Technologies and Patterns Used

* **.NET 9 & C#** â€” Core framework and language
* **ASP.NET Core** â€” HTTP API.
* **Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL** â€” Data access (Repository & Unit of Work patterns) to PostgreSQL database
* **Kafka** â€” Message queue that listens to main events
* **gRPC** â€” High-performance RPC interface
* **Redis** â€” Caching layer
* **Hot Chocolate** â€” GraphQL endpoint with built-in support for pagination, filtering, and sorting
* **Clean Architecture** â€” Layered separation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
* **Outbox Pattern** â€” ensures reliable message delivery to the message queue 
* **Decorator Pattern** â€” allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically without affecting others. In this project, it is used to implement caching.
* **Hangfire** â€” Hosted services for background jobs
* **Observability** â€” Traces, logs, and metrics collected via OpenTelemetry and Logstash, exported to Aspire dashboard, Jaeger, ElasticSearch, and Prometheus
* **Monitoring & Visualization** â€” Dashboards in Grafana, Kibana and Aspire
* **Health Checks** â€” Status endpoints to monitor service availability and dependencies
* **xUnit & Coverlet** â€” Automated unit and integration testing with code coverage
* **SonarQube & Qodana** â€” Code quality and coverage analysis

## Architecture and Design
This service follows the principles of Clean Architecture. The solution is split into multiple projects that correspond to each architectural layer.

![Clean Architecture](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_017/clean_architecture.png?imwidth=1920)

| Layer | Project |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Presentation** | QuestionService.GraphQl, QuestionService.Api |
| **Application** | QuestionService.Application |
| **Domain** | QuestionService.Domain |
| **Infrastructure** | QuestionService.BackgroundJobs, QuestionService.Cache, QuestionService.DAL, QuestionService.Grpc, QuestionService.Messaging, QuestionService.Outbox |

## Getting Started for developers

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Configure `appsettings.json` in `.NET User Secrets` in `QuestionService.Api` with your database and Redis.
   Example: 
   ```json
    {
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "PostgresSQL": "Server=localhost;Port=5435; Database=question-service-db; User Id=<YOUR-USER-ID>; Password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>"
    },
    "RedisSettings": {
      "Password": "<YOUR-PASSWORD>"
    }
   }
   ```
3. Start the [UserService](https://github.com/flow-OverStack/UserService/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-for-developers) first, as QuestionService depends on it and common services (such as Kafka, Keycloak, etc.)
4. Start dependencies (you can use [Quick Start](#-quick-start-a-ready-made-api) or run your own services)
5. Run the API:

   ```bash
   cd QuestionService.Api
   dotnet run
   ```
## API Documentation

The following endpoints are available by default:

| REST API & Swagger | GraphQL Endpoint | 
| ------------------ | ---------------- | 
| https://localhost:7067/swagger |	https://localhost:7067/graphql | 

## Testing

Run unit and functional tests:

```bash
cd QuestionService.Tests
dotnet test --filter Category=Functional
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
```
